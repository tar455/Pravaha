# Pravaha
This project is a personal yet purposeful effort to contribute something meaningful to my country — a step toward technological self-reliance and innovation in the browser ecosystem.

Pravaha aims to be lightweight, secure, and developer-friendly, built using modern technologies with a strong focus on performance, accessibility, and user experience tailored for Indian users.

This is currently an early-stage, self-driven project, guided by a long-term vision rather than short-term gains. With the right support, Pravaha has the potential to grow into a truly Made-in-India browser platform.

I am actively seeking sponsorship, mentorship, and strategic support from individuals, organizations, and institutions who believe in empowering homegrown technology and contributing to India’s digital future.

Any form of support—technical, financial, or advisory—will help accelerate development and bring this vision closer to reality.
